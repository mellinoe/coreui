# coreui

This is a crude .NET wrapper of [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui).

## libui
https://github.com/andlabs/libui
> Simple and portable (but not inflexible) GUI library in C that uses the native GUI technologies of each platform it supports.

## Building

dotnet restore
msbuild build.proj

* Outside windows, build libui yourself and put it somewhere the program can find.
