# coretemplate

This repo provides a barebones template for creating multi-platform applications running on CoreCLR. It links in a small set of build targets which set up a very basic build environment from https://github.com/mellinoe/corebuild.

#Requirements
* Visual Studio 2015 (MSBuild 14.0)
* .NET CLI or NuGet.exe (for restoring NuGet packages)

# Setup/Build instructions
First, clone the repo recursively (`git clone --recursive https://github.com/mellinoe/coretemplate <path>`)

Building in VS is easier and more user-friendly, but not completely necessary.

## Building in VS
1. Open src/TestProj.sln
2. Select your configuration (Windows, Ubuntu, OSX)
3. Build
4. Optionally, set a break point and debug the program

## Building outside VS
1. run `dotnet restore` to restore the packages for the solution
2. run `msbuild /p:Configuration=Windows_Debug` (or another configuration, depending on your target OS)

# Build Artifacts
* The intermediate objects from the build will be placed in ````<root>/bin/obj/<arch>/<platform>_<config>/````
* The binaries will be placed in ````<root>/bin/<arch>/<platform>_config/````
* Executable projects' bin/ directories will include a full runtime and all library dependencies, ready to be copied to the target platform and run. If you are building on Windows, you can immediately run the <project>.exe file and launch your program on CoreCLR.
